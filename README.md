Producing transcript of youtube video

I'm currently working on an article about intergenerational trauma in Korea due to various episodes occurring throughout history.
One of the various sources I refer to in my piece is the "U.S.-Korea Relations: Retrospective on the Jeju April 3 Incident, Human Rights, and Alliance"
presentation at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, DC, in Dec. 2022. 

Initially, I found myself manually typing out comments made by the panelists, but since the video is approximately 3 hours long, I decided this was not
logical. I googled and found https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api, which was my initial starting point, but tweaked the code so that a)
timestamps also appeared every 30 seconds and b) the transcript is printed to a txt file. 

The final transcript can be seen in the attached file "transcript_with_timestamps.txt".
