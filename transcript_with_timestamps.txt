okay let's get started
thank you good afternoon my name is Sumi
Terry I'm the director of the Asia
program and director of the Hyundai
Motor career Foundation Center for
[00:00:31] Korean history and public policy here at
the Woodrow Wilson Center
I'll try to talk slower because I hear
that there's a translation
um for those of you who may not know the
Woodrow Wilson Center was established by
the act of Congress in 1968 as a
non-partisan living Monument to our 28th
president to serve as a bridge between
scholarship and policy makers
our purpose uh in the words of
[00:01:03] congressional Charter is to strengthen
the fruitful relations between the world
of learning
in the world of public affairs
our currency is knowledge and our focus
is independent analysis
we place value on history and Regional
context
and really fold them into our products
so it is a pleasure for the Woodrow
Wilson Center to host this special
conference on the Jeju April 3rd
[00:01:34] incident in the broader context of Human
Rights history and the U.S rock Alliance
next year marks the 70th anniversary of
the signing of the Armistice of the
Korean War the U.S rock Alliance a
special Alliance that is forged in blood
that has withstood the test of time
the past seven decades has seen a period
of immense growth for South Korea both
in political and economic development
[00:02:04] and a period of long peace in the
peninsula
imperfect and shaky at times but no war
has broken out right we don't have a war
that has broken out in the region for
the past decades uh much I would say
thanks to are iron-clad Alliance
today's South Korea uh with the world's
sixth largest military and 10th largest
economy has become an increasingly
important partner for the United States
[00:02:36] and an increasingly important player on
the global stage and together the United
States and South Korea really have a
historic opportunity to create a closer
Alliance for the 21st century so in this
context today we are here to examine the
Jeju April 3rd incident and other human
rights issues with a view toward further
strengthening
our alliance and solidarity between the
[00:03:06] governments and peoples of our two great
Nations
by joining jointly examining the past
and trying lessons from history I'm
confident that we can build brighter
future together
um so with that before we begin our
conference I would like to First Express

Alliance in historical context
we just start
I could try I'll do my best well thank
you everyone for taking the time out of
[00:10:11] your very busy schedule to be here with
us and thank you Dr Terry and the Wilson
Center for this opportunity to share
with you some of my views on this very
dark chapter in Korean history
the overwhelming role of the United
States in determining shaping the future
of South Korea presents some big
questions
from liberating Korea
from 35 years of Japanese Colonial rule
[00:10:45] by vanquishing Imperial Japan in 1945
and immediately thereafter with the
Soviet Union partitioning the Korean
Peninsula into two halves
to abandoning South Korea in 1949
despite having governed South Korea for
three years to the very next year
returning to South Korea to defend it
against the North Korean invading forces
the U.S has played enormous roles first
[00:11:16] as Liberator perhaps even as the Midwife
in facilitating the separate and
controversial elections in South Korea
only under the auspices of the United
Nations on May 10 1948 and thereby
playing a major role in the birth of the
Republic of Korea to really
saving South Korea from State collapse
in 1950 and thereafter the often touted
[00:11:47] iron-clad alliance between South Korea
and the United States which has grown
tremendously over the last seven decades
into not an ordinary Alliance but a
truly special Alliance based on the
shared values and beliefs and systems of
democracy peace freedom and justice
it is something to behold
the special bilateral relationship
between the U.S and South Korea yet
[00:12:21] 75 years ago
the United States oversaw events that
perhaps I would deem paint as the
antithesis the opposite of democracy
human rights peace and Justice and I
refer to you ladies and gentlemen as you
might surmise to the prolonged
mass killings and torture of civilians
including women over 3 000 women killed
[00:12:54] including children over 800 children
under the age of 10 also killed
an extreme human rights violation like
this can never be swept under the rug
but successive South Korean regimes did
their best to do just that
censorship during the singly years from
1948 to 1960 and also during the
patreonghi years from 1961 to 1979 meant
[00:13:25] that South Koreans were not entirely
free to raise questions
inconvenient and uncomfortable questions
about the Jeju Massacre
it also meant that the United States saw
no compelling need
to study to remember and to raise issues
about the U.S role
as these Mass atrocities were committed
by South Korean instruments of power the
[00:13:57] constabulary the police force and so on
what makes this issue particularly
difficult to remember to face frankly
and to honor the victims is that during
the most intense period of the brutal
Crackdown and the mass killings
the South Korean instruments of force
still lay under the operational control
of the United States military government
and I refer to the period following the
[00:14:30] formal establishment of the Republic of
Korea on August 15 1948
the next month in September 1948 South
Korean troops killed confirmed number
153 these numbers are all very
conservative but these are confirmed
cases in October 1948 South Korean
troops killed over 800 folks in November
2205. in December
[00:15:01] almost 3 000 people
2974 January
over 2000 and so on until
the US military withdrew at the end of
June 1949 again during this period the
United States military held sway held
operational command and control over the
deployment of South Korean forces
so rather than try to forget the past
rather than hide behind the wall of
[00:15:33] denialism in my humble opinion
I think this is an issue that should be
taught remembered
yeah
visited frequently
and the victims honored
it's an issue that must be remembered in
perpetuity and what is the best way to
remember it well to discuss what
happened
to explore jointly ways to commemorate
and honor the victims and also to seek
[00:16:06] healing and Reconciliation
and as many of you know for the first
time ever in South Korean history the
top leader of a conservative party
president-elect young in April became
the first top leader of the conservative
party to pay his respects
by visiting the Jeju peace Park
I think that's a meaningful symbolic act
toward healing and mitigating the Deep
[00:16:37] ideological divide within South Korean
Society
and when I observed this welcome
development in early April
eitherafter wrote a humble op-ed calling
for one day President Biden
to visit perhaps together with President
noon the Church of Peace Park thus
showing that the United States is not
only a just Nation but cares for human
[00:17:07] rights of its allies
that the United States cares about the
past
that the United States is not afraid to
face the ghosts of the past
President Obama as President in May 2016
together with prime minister Shinzo Ade
visited the Hiroshima Peace Park
it was somewhat controversial
perhaps understandably some families of
[00:17:39] U.S veterans in the second world war
were not thrilled
but President Obama at the park said the
following memories must never fade
memory allows us to fight complacency
it fuels our moral imagination
it allows us
to change
and although it's been only six years or
so six and a half years since this event
[00:18:10] I think history will judge that visit by
President Obama as good moral
and just
and I think a visit by let's say a U.S
Congress person or a senator or vice
president or one day the president
history will judge that visit to the
treasure peace Park as good moral and
just in closing
in 1908
[00:18:40] the U.S Congress passed an act
a bill to allow for the U.S share of
money
that was extracted from Ching China
for Chinese people who attacked foreign
ligations in 1899 and 1900 in the boxer
Uprising so-called in the wake of the
death of foreign Nationals at the hands
of the Chinese
those Nations concerned
[00:19:11] 13 Nations sent troops into the Qing
Dynasty to China
to exact Revenge
and the Chinese the Qing dynasty was
forced to pay a huge indemnity
money
a few years after that in 1908 Congress
passed a law that allowed for the U.S
share about half over half of what U.S
received the U.S received to use AS
[00:19:41] Scholarship
for Chinese students
who wish to come and study in the United
States
I would
very comfortably
with confidence argue that history has
judged that gesture to be good moral and
just
thus if Congress one day were to take a
similar step similar measures
and appropriated funds to allow for the
[00:20:12] victims of the Jeju
April 3rd Massacre to come and study in
the United States I humbly believe that
history will judge that gesture to be
good moral and just
thank you
thank you Dr Lee for shedding light on
History just quick question this is
ignorant question but before we move to
miss Yang I I think you know I I must
confess that I think very
[00:20:44] not many people are aware of the April 4
April 3rd incident including myself I
mean I think U.S policy makers career
watches Community when we talk about
Guangzhou Uprising many people know
about it but this incident is something
that's not widely recognized or if
there's a very little understanding of
or oldness of knowledge of just quick
question on when you just compare to
something like huangju Uprising why is
it that you think there's just a little
recognition and awareness of this
incident
[00:21:15] because the konju uprising took place
over the course of eight days in May
1980 and it's another horrific tragedy
in modern Korean political history
but there have been charges made that
the U.S embassy or in particular the U.S
forces the commander of the U.S forces
in Korea or somehow implicated even
complicit in the disproportionate cruel
use of force the killings of protesters
[00:21:49] um the two issues in my humble opinion
are very different the cheju tragedy was
prolonged it took really place it took
place really from March 1947 and was not
resolved until seven years later
in 1954 September 1954
there is a qualitative difference in the
role of the United States again in that
during the Jeju incident the United
States military had full control over
[00:22:21] the South Korean forces whereas in 1980
in Guangzhou there is certainly more
than plausible
uh denial that is there is you know
there is plausible argument
strong argument I would say that the
United States officials were in the dark
and
one allegation always has been a
constant allegation that has been well
the United States Commander held
operational control over the deployment
of South Korean troops so either the U.S
[00:22:54] Commander said yes approved it or should
be
should be you know responsible for that
move of the movement of Frontline
soldiers into battle ready soldiers who
committed these crimes
um not really because chanduan did just
that without informing the U.S Commander
he moved troops
in December 1979 in the wake of Papa
John's death in October so to be
tried to try to be trying to be concise
[00:23:25] the fact that Americans don't know
hardly anything about
Jeju does not surprise me but it's
mainly because there has never been any
political need for the United States to
revisit the past thanks and much to the
censorship enforced under the singlenry
and park Changi governments in South
Korea
okay thank you
um so I'm going to turn to miss Yang now
I understand your own family has been
[00:23:55] deeply touched by these historical
events so if you could just provide your
perspective and personal account that'd
be great thank you good afternoon my
sister thank you to Dr Sumit Terry and
Kelly lauta and Wilson Center for
hosting this event
also special thanks to oh young and
governor of JeJu special self-governing
Province and the cohiban chairman of JJ
April 30 piece Foundation to support
this event
um yeah I represent Jeju April 3rd
[00:24:27] Memorial and families Association of the
United States I'm a third generation
victim of the judge Massacre
Jeju Island at the third most tip of
South Korea is the largest island in
Korea with population of
670 thousands on 2021. it is Beautiful
by conic Island listed as a UNESCO world
heritage site
many people go on their honeymoon to
[00:24:57] Jeju Island and currently
they are many Koreans who dream of
living in Jeju
it is not easy to imagine that there is
a tragedy on Jeju Island almost 30 000
people
towns of the island population were
killed or disappeared
island is sad Island for the people who
live there
I would like to inform you that some
[00:25:30] survivors of generations
they still remember the events
vividually after more than 70 years have
passed
when my father was eight years old on
January 2nd 1949 soldiers stormed his
house in Dorian dong and took my
grandfather away my father was playing
in the backyard and was not detected by
[00:26:02] the soldiers
my grandfather
never returned to home
he was killed along with other villagers
my grandfather was an ordinary citizen
unrelated to the Workers Party of South
Korea
both of my father's Brothers my uncles
who lived with my grandfather were also
taken away
they had no idea why they were being
[00:26:32] taken my uncle young
who had come come home from starting
painting in Japan was taken to Daegu
prison and another Uncle young was taken
to Guangzhou prison since there were no
prisons in Jeju Island at that time many
young people from Jeju were taken to
prisons on the mainland
it is presumed that they were sentenced
[00:27:05] to death without legal
representation or proper trial my
uncle's never came home again
my grandmother died soon after my
grandfather and uncles were taken away
by soldiers so my father grew up as an
opera
throughout his life my father longed for
his grandfather feeling guilty about
only seeing him dragged away from him
[00:27:37] the trauma my father support affected to
me as well
my two younger brothers and I were born
in Seoul when I finished my second grade
in elementary school my father said that
we would move to Georgia Island that
this surprised me
Jeju Island was only on our plane
right from Seoul but it felt strange and
[00:28:07] far away that was the first time I knew
that my parents Hometown was Jesuit
Island my father and mother never told
me stories about their Hometown at the
time Korea was generally on the
development and people from all of the
country were plucking to Seoul the
capital
both of my parents are from Jeju Island
they also met and married on the island
but they moved the Seoul and had the
children
[00:28:38] and so my father owned the westerners
western style house and had a stable job
however he decided to abandon his job in
Seoul after 10 years and returned to his
hometown
he moved his family back to Jeju so
that he could take care of his grave of
his deceased parents brothers and
relatives according to the Confucian
tradition
but Graves of my grandfather and two
[00:29:10] uncles were empty
their body was never found my father
wanted to find their remains and redeem
redeemed their honor
but I didn't hear about when and how my
grandfather died until I was in Middle
School at the time my father was afraid
be known that we were families of a
victim of April 3rd incident
[00:29:40] when I came to Jeju I was the only
student from Seoul in my school book
Elementary School and the students were
curious and came to see me they called
me Mainland girl because I wanted to fit
it I tried to learn just to dialect and
make a friend with them
one day
my younger brother said he wanted to
become a civil servant later my father
said it would be impossible because of
[00:30:11] the guilt by association principle
the victims of the April 3rd incident
and their descendant labeled as Arrest
so rebuilding that they were the ever
third victim's family meant taking
social disadvantages in the in the 1980s
in Korea a divided country where the
Cold War was still ongoing
families of victims were automated by
[00:30:44] guilt by association system
and the National Security Law
so many pursued survivors had to hide
from the outside that they were victims
family
the children of the slaughtered had to
be silent
when I was young
the April 3rd incident was taboo world
mentors scars
from tortures such as
[00:31:15] positive traumatic stress disorder and
the red complex were not healed
the number of victims come from Dubai
Jeju every third committee is 14
532 as of 2020 800.
um 18
children on the age 10 and then
2534 young people under 20 were included
and also 3054 women were killed it
[00:31:49] this is only official number of victims
and the fact finding report estimate the
Casual test at the time of the April 3rd
between 25
000 and the 40 000 people
at the time more than tenths of the
population of Jeju Island lost their
lives
currently
the U.S government has not made any
mention of the Jesuit April
[00:32:20] incident
the Korean government has never raised
the issue it officially or unofficially
and the association could believe the
families April third victims which claim
U.S responsibility
visited the embassy of the United States
in Seoul
the U.S denied the responsibility for
the massacre in Georgia
like a U.S government claims some people
[00:32:51] say
the South Korean military
police
and the far-right group were only
involved and have a responsibility in
judge mask directly not the United
military government but that is not true
what I
present no president president and U.S
lieutenant General John Hutch of a U.S
[00:33:22] military government signed executive
agreement
concerning internal military and
security merits during the traditional
period on August 24 1948.
according to this agreement even though
the government of a republic of Korea
was
is not established the U.S military
government would continue to have
operation control over both the army
[00:33:53] and the police of the Republic of Korea
as long as U.S forces remained in Korea
such control of Korean military by U.S
military government has been confirmed
in various place even after
establishment of the Korean government
according to a secret U.S military
report U.S Brigham year General William
[00:34:23] Roberts sent a letter to minister Lee
bombserk of National Defense on
September 29 1948.
start stating that operation control of
the Korean constability still arrested
with the Commanding General of the U.S
Armed Force in Korea and it is of the
Paramount importance
therefore
that all orders pertaining to
operational control of the Contemporary
[00:34:56] be cleared with the appropriate American
advisor
prior to public publication publication
the authority
to exercise operational control
was not a symbolic one
but a specific and direct one
on October 9 1948 the U.S Brigadier
[00:35:29] General Robert rochette Captain trywell
the U.S military advisor to the fifth
Brigade to effectively
intervene in the operation on Jeju
Island
actual Korean military operations such
as troops movement and firing orders
require the U.S military permission
which was controlled through the United
States military Advisory Group
[00:36:02] to the Republic of Korea dispatched to
each subordinate unit
the 9th and second regiment
stations in Jeju Island and committed
the massacre of civilians were no
exception
even in March 49th
when the Masters occurred
the U.S military had been recording the
[00:36:34] situation in the form of the daily
report called the G2 report through the
various information lines
however U.S military officials
dispatched as advisors to the judging
reason at the time included
Harold fish grown U.S military advisor
of nice residents regiment claimed in
interview with Korean historians and
reporters in 2001
that they were not present at the mascot
[00:37:08] in various U.S military records there is
information that will convince us
that U.S military government lead that
and supported the Jeju Island Massacre
on October 22nd 1948 yeah Rigo General
reported joined the general budgets on
Jeju Island he sent a petrol to budgets
[00:37:39] instruction him to hunt down the rivers
from the Korean mainland
okay so time's up so in conclusion the
yes intervention
in Jeju Island at the time of the April
3rd Massacre includes the following
first the U.S forces Korea commander and
advisors gave all the directly to the
Korean police and guards and predecessor
of the Republic of Korean army and
[00:38:11] second
the U.S military advisers in Jesu
actually conducted air and land
operations third
U.S military-based stationed on Jeju
Island delivered logistical support and
information to Korean suppression Force
while managing and supervising the
operation
[Music]
[00:38:42] okay the April
1948 that incident is the biggest mask
of civilians in South Korean history
it took place at the time when the
United States military government in
Korea governed in South Korea people
have established a republic of Korea
later in August
in the best interest of U.S South Korea
relations
the U.S South Korea Alliance and mutual
cooperation and historical
[00:39:14] reconciliation the United States should
acknowledge its moral responsibility and
honor
the victims and their family with the
statement of policy
JJ person memory of families Association
of the United States to find out the
truth about the judge April 3rd incident
we demand that they release more top
secret documents
I established an academic platform for
[00:39:46] the world in Korea to survey the danger
of the state violence at the value of
the human rights and fees to the
American public through the April 3rd JH
Massacre will continue to conduct
various academic and cultural activities
in the future thank you very much
thank you thank you for the very deeply
personal account
um I think we do all sympathize with the
pain and Collective trauma of victims
and families and we do look ahead for
genuine reconciliation and healing
[00:40:17] um your
comment about killed by association is
so disturbing to me because it just
reminds me of yet another country that
we're so familiar with where the
exercise killed by association so this
has kind of triggered that a little bit
of course I'm talking about North Korea
next we'll turn to Mr John Young a long
time scholar of these issues and the
former chairman of the chezu peace
Foundation he played a critical role in
leading up to official Korean
[00:40:47] presidential apology for the victim of
the Jeju incident
so Mr Young
please yeah

foreign
[00:51:37] foreign
foreign
[00:52:11] investigation reports found three parts
first is the leaders of the Korean army
this is the Korean army Chief of Staff
bangdok Che who paid a visit to Jeju and
then regimental Commander young Johnson
led the eradication operation
second is Roque president is a man who
declared martial law over Jeju the
cabinet meeting records of those days
[00:52:42] showed that he ordered a ruthless
Crackdown on the incident
in order to get more support and aid
from the US
what does it mean
s
comment urge the quick conclusion of the
treasure uprising
and he's Faithfully responded to such
requests
the third party accountable is the U.S
leaders
[00:53:14] when the Republic of Korea was founded
in August 1948
yes military Advisory Group had the
right of operation of the Korean Armed
Forces led by General William Roberts
a letter written by General Roberts to
the Minister of Defense of Korea was
found and it was dated December 18th
1948 right after the entire island of
[00:53:45] JeJu was set on fire and burned to the
ground
in the letter he said regimental
Commander sung did a wonderful job as a
leader make sure to announce it in a
presidential statement
three days later the chief of staff of
the Korean army Che responded by saying
Lieutenant song and U.S adviser to Jeju
proved their competency in Jeju as you
suggested presidential statement will be
[00:54:16] made and general Zone will be decorated
here I'd like to point out that all the
equipment weapons and bullets used in
the eradication campaign
which one
and reconnaissance
planes was applied from the U.S Army in
Korea
all these indicate the involvement of
[00:54:49] the U.S forces and the ruthless
operation
now April 3rd Uprising has been banned
from public discussion for half a
century it was a suppressed and branded
as communist Rebellion
these are those people who were arrested
for making investigations into the
uprising or rising or writing or novel
on it despite heart censorship during
those days
[00:55:19] all those oppressions could not stop
people from making efforts to ascertain
the truth in 1998 making the 50th
anniversary of April 3rd there was a
street demonstration asking for a
legislation of a special act on April
3rd local councils family members of the
victims and civil organizations during
the demonstration later in 2000 special
acts on April 3rd was enacted and then
president Kim desun invited those who
[00:55:50] made it possible to the blue house
here you can see to the right the second
to the right
is
director go or charmingo who made a
speech at the beginning and right behind
the present is me
three-year government investigations
ensued to come to a conclusion
that the government infringed upon the
human rights in Jeju
[00:56:21] later in 2003 president
made an apology
Fresno was the first South Korean
president to apologize for the 1948
Massacre
this sparked reconciliation movements
among people living in teju they started
to see the event from a different
perspective before the Milestone apology
they thought it was an internal conflict
[00:56:52] between resident groups living in Jeju
or conflict between Jeju populars
against those from the mainland however
the truths revealed that April 3rd is an
outcome of the conflict on the current
Peninsula or the Cold War we started to
see it with the history world history in
its background to realize that the weak
and helpless suffer when the big Powers
collide
so they started to ask leaders to take
[00:57:25] responsibility for what was done and
happened and then consider those killed
as victims later in 2013 something
miraculous happened the victim family
representatives and the police
friendship Association of JeJu announced
a joint statement that they reached Aid
reconciliation
after that they have held joint respect
or worship ceremony to the victims on
August the 2nd every year
[00:57:57] they started to pay their respect
together
at the Chung hon Cemetery where the
spirit of soldiers and police officers
were enshrined and the April 3rd Park
where a memorial tablets of the victims
of the forestry incident are held not
only the two groups but also has of
different organizations representative
of the ruling and operation party during
the search movement
the now Progressive and conservative the
ruling and operation parties and private
[00:58:29] and government now come together in
Treasure Island to join the journey for
healing from the April 3rd Incident
That's not all many projects are already
on their way to restore the honor of the
victims
in particular with with the amendment of
the special act for April 3rd they put
into Force last year the government
started to Grant compensation of seventy
thousand dollars per victim
those people who were imprisoned at the
[00:59:01] time of the incident are now being
acquitted one after another the
government fact finding and throw me
trauma healing project have been rolled
out besides there have been four
presidential apologies including the
ones made by President no moyhun and
mundane incumbent President nunsongyo
also promised to do his best to restore
the honor of the victims
Justice is being served April 3rd is now
[00:59:32] presenting itself as a model to show how
wrongdoings of the past could be
reserved
the remains
what remains unreserved
until now
what is that that is the role
responsibility and position of the U.S
back in 2003 after the April 3rd study
meeting was held at Harvard University
there were several events taking place
asking the U.S government to make clear
[01:00:04] its position on this matter three years
ago in 2019 the April 3rd Symposium was
held at the U.N headquarters in New York
where the issue of the U.S
responsibility was discussed
and there was also a resolution made
to hold such an event in Washington DC
too however
covid-19 was in our way
but finally
[01:00:35] we have this Symposium here today
in the presence of you
he tries Wrangle a former congressman
and also a congressman of the U.S
attended the event that I'm a veteran of
Korean War
the Korean us Alliance has become
stronger than ever over the years
history issues such as Jeju April 3rd
must also be reserved with honesty in
[01:01:08] order to take our relation to another
level that's what he said exactly
we are not doing this
to remain stuck in the past I believe
that today's event is Meaningful in that
it can further strengthen the
relationship between Korea and the US
and help us resolve the problems of the
past with honesty and move forward for a
better future ladies and Gentlemen
please help thank you so I think it's
[01:01:39] pretty clear that it's been a long time
scholar of this historical issue thank
you so much for this very comprehensive
and thorough presentation so we're not
going to turn to Ambassador Stevens
Ambassador Stevens you have been a
special and dear friend to the South
Korean people
um in your three different tours to
Korea right as a Peace Corps volunteer
in rural career and teacher a tour in
the uh as a political officer uh in the
U.S embassy in Seoul
um really focused on reporting on
[01:02:10] Korea's domestic political and human
rights issues your
um your U.S in Busan right
um and of course U.S ambassador to South
Korea as a first Korean speaker I
believe in your studies in Korean
language and culture we'll just love
your thoughts now from everything you've
heard on your perspective on what you've
just heard and but also broadening it
out a bit
um what would you say are some of the
main issues in U.S rock bilateral
[01:02:41] relations in terms of you know so much
about the Korean people how would you
qualify the Korean character resilience
the perseverance a little comment on
that will be also great Ambassador
Stevens gosh well thank you I think Dr
Terry Sumi I uh I feel even after that
that or especially after the
introduction completely inadequate to
follow these very thoughtful and moving
uh presentations that we've heard
already this morning but I am honored to
share the stage with all of you and if I
[01:03:12] may say to be back in person at the
Wilson Center again and I would
associate in second the remarks you made
at the beginning so about
um what you try to do here at the Wilson
Center I remember a few years ago seems
like a long long time ago because it was
pre-pandemic when I was here in this
Auditorium when we talked about the
1980s and I did live in Korea uh for six
years in the 1980s and Korean
democratization and my sense then that
the doing those oral histories doing
some in Korea as well sharing with our
[01:03:42] Korean colleagues both our our memories
of the time I I don't have personal
memories obviously none of us do and
this is why it's very challenging but we
appreciate the personal testimonies as
painful as they are that we've heard
but I think it's extremely valuable
for all the reasons that have already
been stated but also going forward uh to
to ensure that we continue to deepen and
strengthen our our bonds and our
understanding and our work together
um I have to say I do have a I feel I
[01:04:15] have a special tie to jejudo I'm sure
probably everyone in this room feels
like they do because it's not a place
that you visit and forget I did first go
there and I think 1976
and I actually spent my last two two
weeks in uh in Korea and I haven't told
this story before and sorry to be in in
1977 before I left Korea for the first
time uh in sogypo in a a farm village
where I think there's a giant hotel now
of course that could be anywhere but uh
but I always think of that every time I
[01:04:45] go back to chejado and I have uh
been lucky enough to go back to chojito
over the years you'll hear from speakers
this afternoon John Merrill he and I
visited together in the 1980s and of
course Dr Moon Chung in and thanks to
him I've been gone back a number of
times even post ambassadorship uh to the
Jeju peace Forum which I think is uh as
most of you probably know an
international Forum held every year in
jejudo which brings together people to
[01:05:17] talk about a whole range of issues but I
think also serves to highlight the
special role that that the island of
JeJu has and the people of JeJu have in
our work together and in the world
um
so I I'm glad to join this and I'm not a
scholar but I do think as a as a student
and still a student of Korean history uh
for many many years uh and of the U.S
Korea relationship I think that a lot of
Americans even those who uh know a lot
about Korea in many ways uh kind of Mark
[01:05:49] the history of U.S Korean relations for
maybe from June 25th 1950 and the period
before is uh a bit understudied and in
particular the difficult period between
Liberation in 1945 and and the years
that followed uh I think is is relevant
to understanding the complexity of our
relationships and so as painful as it
can be uh I I I welcome the fact that
this panel and all of you here today are
[01:06:19] are ready to confront it
um I just had really a few comments I
don't know if I can talk much about
maybe later in our our in our q's and
A's about the U.S career relationship
but a couple of comments on on what I
heard uh today when I moved to say
um
one is uh and Miss Young I really
appreciate your your testimony and
you're mentioning as uh of the the guilt
by association uh you said principle it
was a law I guess and
[01:06:51] um and I think we we all of it kind of
forget that maybe some of us forget it
because you were too young to remember
um but you know when I lived in Korea
and again this was just personal
testimony as a foreigner uh with you
know very modest Korean language skills
but in the 1970s and the 1980s so people
didn't talk about a lot of things I mean
I think there was a collective trauma we
use that a lot these days which I did
not recognize in many ways at the time
as a young American there uh in a
country that was determinedly trying to
move forward and determining not like
[01:07:22] trying not to look back but there was
also as you say censorship or worse and
and the notion of guilt by association
was was written into the law and it
really occurred to me how important this
was actually and this is one of the
unfortunate things I had about going
back to Korea a number of times with
with absences in between as Ambassador
when I was there as Ambassador and this
was probably in 2010 I believe
I took advantage of my position in many
ways but one was I invited people who
[01:07:54] were retired but I had and who had been
way too senior for me to know back in
the 1980s but would in their retirement
years graciously come to lunch at the
ambassador's residence and I would ask
him about
their thoughts
and I I'm not sure I should name the
person but you probably I I hosted a
former prime minister who had held many
senior positions in the South Korean
government in the 70s and 80s many
positions and and I asked him what are
you most proud of I mean honestly there
[01:08:25] are probably some things he wasn't very
proud of it's probably true of all of us
but it was a difficult time and he said
to me the thing that I'm most proud of
is that during my tenure we got rid of
the guilt by association law
that was the 1980s now for some of us
that's not not so long ago and ever
since then together I thought you know
when I read about when I hear the
testimony from from people coming from
North Korea and I hear why they came
many times they talk about guilt by
association and I thought you know that
is a human rights issue that was
[01:08:57] addressed but very much alive and very
much affected the families of JeJu and
maybe psychologically it still hangs
over and something that we we need to
keep in mind uh when we talk about about
about human rights in North Korea so uh
but yes I I I I saw the burden myself of
maybe your parents generation and and I
think it's continued uh to to weigh very
heavily with all that said I also want
to say how much I admire
um the courage and the rigor of people
[01:09:29] like
Miss Young Mr Yang and others who are
here in in continuing to research and
present the evidence and try to uh have
an honest discussion about uh about
those terrible days and about their
aftermath
um
again we can talk about and I don't know
what the answer is I don't work for the
US government anymore as to what kind of
official statement should be made or
gesture should be made I mean certainly
I think uh those of us who served in
[01:10:01] Korea have tried to do our part
understanding the important role the key
role the United States has played
I hope mostly for good but but sometimes
it's been a very complicated and
difficult relationship
um but also recognizing the complexity
of it to to try to contribute to
reconciliation in uh in the Republic of
Korea and to contribute to a more honest
and and strong relationship across the
board across the board with the people
of the Republic of Korea but you know
how I'm sure we've had some missed
[01:10:32] opportunities and we have work to do
ahead
I was recalling uh when Professor Lee
mentioned that um
uh that that I guess no serving or you
know that you know you're suggesting a
presidential visit to sejudo I think
um I remember in I wasn't there but in
1996 uh President Bill Clinton visited
jejudo and had a summit meeting with
then president Kim Young song
and uh actually as I was uh getting
ready for this this morning you can see
I I looked on my phone I looked up uh to
[01:11:04] check the date it was April 1996 when uh
President Clinton stopped in chejado and
had the summit and the focus then was
again this is 1996 so in the midst of
trying to move forward with the work
with North Korea under the agreed
framework and they had a press
conference I just looked over the press
conference the press conference is all
about the agreement to have four party
talks with North Korea so North and
South Korea China and the U.S
um and uh and that was a worthy Endeavor
like a lot of worthy Endeavors it didn't
work out it failed and that work goes on
[01:11:37] uh but I thought maybe it was a sign of
the times that there was no mention of
the need for reconciliation within the
Republic of Korea itself now this is
work that I think the Korean people in
South Korea have done very steadily and
for example I did not know about the
2013 meeting which happened after I was
Ambassador there and and that that it
shows this effort to kind of keep moving
forward but the U.S can and should be
appropriately a part of that and I think
that's the work that we all need to
[01:12:08] think about going forward because I
think what the thing that pains me as
someone who's witnessed so much in South
Korea is extraordinary not only economic
but Democratic rise is that um the the
modern virus not talking about covid but
the modern virus of polarization and
partisanship I think threatens all of us
in a way and we see it on issues like
this and there is a need for whether the
word is reconciliation or finding some
common ground I think is uh is stronger
than ever and finally I guess I would
[01:12:38] say where I was thinking about 19 1996
when President Clinton Kim young son met
in Che Judo and there's actually a
beautiful picture of them I've uh
walking across one of the yellow fields
of JeJu I I know some of the White House
was very proud of that picture because
they they composed that picture these
are these are Big pieces and yes the big
symbolic steps can be important but I
was actually at that that time living in
Northern Ireland and I was about Midway
through a four-year effort I was
involved in for reconciliation and a
more permanent peace regime in the north
[01:13:10] of Ireland and and between Ireland and
and and the UK and again the U.S I think
for historical reasons in some ways had
an interest and tried to play a
constructive part in that and I was um I
was thinking about now this would be my
final little comment here
um I was thinking about a poem I would
recommend the the the interpreters may
not like this but a poem I would
recommend to you by a poem a poet from
Northern Ireland Seamus Haney who I
think won the Nobel Prize and he wrote
it in 1975 and and it's uh the title of
[01:13:43] the poem is say nothing or whatever you
say say nothing and the part of the poem
is about that and I think it gets to
what Miss Young was talking about that
we have to make sure that we say
something
the poem is where to be saved and this
is where to be saved you only must save
faith
and whatever you say
nothing
we do have to say something and I really
welcome this Gathering today as a time
to to say something
[01:14:19] as you mentioned this issue truly has
been under and understudied I think is
the word you used
um and the conversation for research
honest discussion I think these are
first steps and I'm glad we're doing it
we only have now what we do have about
18 minutes for Q a so I can open it up
for discussion if anybody have any
questions just raise your hand I do
think we have microphones that are going
around
any takers questions
[01:14:57] well maybe we're trying to Dr Lee first
um I was so
you know I guess the question that I
want to ask the panel is where okay we
we first step I just said is to have a
conference like this to have an honest
conversation to learn I I admitted
myself that I you know this is not an
area that I know much about or and I
think this is also true for many many
Americans so this is why we're having
conference like this to have an honest
conversation but what are the next steps
[01:15:29] beyond that what are we trying to
achieve I mean realistically speaking
you know we talked about U.S trying to
have some sort of official statement I
don't think right now at this stage it's
a realistic
[Music]
um
perspective just just because I think
again the issue has not been even I
don't think many people know about it as
much as what maybe we'll start with Dr
Lee like what what where do we go from
here in this context in terms of next
steps what are we trying to achieve why
we give audience time to ask think about
[01:16:00] some questions
well every historical issue of great
sensitivity like this takes time to
raise awareness on it takes time to
represent the facts and the truth it
takes time to cajole compel persuade
neutral parties especially governments
to take interest in such sensitive
issues so the journey is long but I
[01:16:30] truly believe beyond the all-important
consideration of healing and
Reconciliation on the part of the
victims and their families I truly
believe that in the long term
that the U.S Republic of Korea bilateral
relationship
the Ironclad Alliance so-called will
become Diamond Club will become much
tougher much stronger much closer if the
[01:17:02] U.S government in some capacity showed
some compassion
and respect
we can start with maybe a low-level
person say visiting the Jeju peace Park
we can start maybe perhaps with
somebody at the U.S embassy in Seoul
making a principled remark in solidarity
with the victims
I don't think it's reasonable to expect
[01:17:32] an official apology at this time these
things
take time
President Obama's visit to Hiroshima
took time much dialogue between the two
sides but maybe our special conference
today
at the Wilson Center can be a catalyst
the start of this long journey so while
I don't think it's a reasonable to
expect tremendous change anytime soon I
[01:18:05] think
we can start by taking a major step
today
what you expect to achieve
Mr Young I see your hand in the audience
but let me let him answer that and then
we'll get to in one second because Miss
William
[01:18:40] conference like this
I feel like we are shooting eggs against
strong rocks so many people have
pessimism
because this rug is so solid and so
strong despite that
even if it is a small struggle we
shouldn't stay still we should influence
all the ngos government or the
conscientious Scholars we should start
[01:19:10] speaking to those people
we are we we want to appeal to the
conscience of the U.S back in 2000 1999
there was a no good knee incident in
Korea
and AP press had an investigative report
and that was a major change and it
resulted in the Bill Clinton issuing a
statement for on that incident and what
so we don't know which will serve as a
[01:19:40] catalyst but as long as we just keep
going making efforts I think there will
be an opportunity that will generate a
catalyst
right so we're not we will take
step-by-step approach so that we will
share this uh the truth and uncover what
really happened at that time thank you
for your comment
hello I'm oh imjong I'm the
[01:20:13] representative of the river to families
we have the victims family and over 900
130 000 people so first I'd like to
thank all those people who made this
conference uh possible
what I like to tell you today is that we
want to talk about future
we had all these tragedy 70 years ago
like my parents never mentioned this
[01:20:43] incident whatsoever because we lost four
family members it's just one day so next
year it will be a
74th anniversary
but they never mentioned this once even
once well I would like to talk about the
future of our Korea and the relationship
between the two countries so Mr Yang
just mentioned the noogly incident and
AP compressed release of a player role
and the U.S started the investigation
[01:21:14] into the lake fact finding its
investigations and Clinton issued a
apology and I think this is the right
path that we should take for Jeju for
three
and we need to have enough discussion
here and the U.S I would like to idem I
demand the U.S to start investigation
and the U.S president should issue an
apology and we should step towards to
the future together and that's the way
[01:21:46] we should resolve for the solution
our victim the victim Community is
determined not to pass on this pain and
suffering to our next generation for
that to happen we need to talk about the
future so that we will never ever repeat
the same uh mistake we've made we made
before and only then we can contribute
to the reconciliation on the word stage
so I think we should work together
[01:22:17] for that to happen so I demand the U.S
government to start the fact-finding and
issue an apology so that we can move
forward
okay
hold down one second oh moderator uh
Dr Terry has ordered me to do it so um
graciously offered thank you
um
hello everyone my name my name is
I'm the chairman of the association of
[01:22:50] the bereaved families of the chegeus
hazam April 3rd incident today there are
over 130
000 family members of the victims of the
Jeju Massacre who are living in South
Korea and Beyond here in the United
States as well as you see
chairman young juhun mentioned the
nogginly massacre which took place in
the fog of war in the Korean War and
[01:23:22] this incident as many of you know refers
to the mass killing of well over 200
unarmed South Koreans who are hiding
under a bridge killing by American
soldiers and in the wake of the
Associated Press reporting on this
terrible
event
the world took notice President Clinton
the sitting president at the time took
notice and delivered a statement of
[01:23:54] regret
and that did a lot to alleviate the hurt
feelings in South Korea so perhaps this
is not a leap not totally unrealistic
that with sustained effort in raising
Awareness on the Jeju incident that we
may one day hope it leads to the U.S
president taking notice of this talk
chapter in U.S career relations and
issue a statement of either apology or
[01:24:25] regret I think this would take our
bilateral relationship to another level
of closeness and friendship
thank you I applied Dr Lee's incredible
memory and translation skills
John
yeah
thanks my name is John Merrill
um
I think you have to be realistic in what
[01:24:57] you attempt to achieve
I just before coming over here
I was watching a movie on Netflix it was
called the night in Paradise it's kind
of a mix of a gangster movie uh
set in in in chejado
and I I'd recommend it to you and the
the heroine is a dying female
star
[01:25:27] um
but um
most Americans don't know anything next
to zero this is in response to the
comment that was just made
about shaju
so you've got a very heavy load to lift
in raising consciousness
right now I don't see any consciousness
of this among the American public in
general
[01:25:58] despite the efforts such as Sumi is
making
in the seminar
one of the things that I think you
should put your efforts to
is the U.S military
they were the ones as has been pointed
out in the last panel who had
operational control
how come the military hasn't owned up to
what it was doing
unchejuda during those years
[01:26:31] another thing I would say which hasn't
been mentioned
in which I didn't put into my paper
which I'll be presenting in a little
while
is
that we speak about changing though too
much as a sui generous a unique
event
chegito was one of a series of popular
uprisings
that flourished almost like bamboo
[01:27:01] sprouts
after a spring rain in the aftermath of
the end of colonialism in Asia
following World War II you had the same
thing happening in Southeast Asia
you had something similar happening in
Taiwan where Chiang Kai-shek
moved in and promptly as his first step
massacred
the entire leadership
[01:27:32] of native Taiwanese until this day this
still hard feelings in Taiwan about that
so I think it would be useful
Maybe
through the Jeju Peace Museum
to host some events
about the
April 3rd Uprising in historical
perspective
and try to see if you can raise
Consciousness throughout the region
[01:28:02] about what happened in chejudo
it's it's very striking when you read
these histories of
some of these rebellions
even Vietnam could be construed as
something of the sort
an attempt to buy indigenous populations
to resist
the forcible reimposition of colonial
structures in the aftermath of World War
II so anyway I think you have an
[01:28:33] enormous
amount of Consciousness raising and I
applaud Sumi for organizing this
conference and maybe bringing some
awareness to Washington D.C
and uh
but it's going to be a very heavy lift
and I don't think speaking I'm a
formerly worked at the state department
as an analyst not
as a Foreign Service Officer but
[01:29:04] I think if you randomly picked
a hundred people
outside the door
of C Street
cafeteria and ask them what they knew
about the change of Uprising you might
be lucky if you got one
two
say something about it it's kind of a
forgotten unknown episode very tragic
episode
in American history
[01:29:34] uh so
hopefully we can get into this a little
bit more this afternoon
yeah no there's some lady behind you oh
thank you for your talk today my name is
and I am a professor at Gettysburg
College and I'm happy to share that I
got the opportunity to teach about two
koreas at the college for the first time
and and um it as John just mentioned it
[01:30:08] is true that many American young
students do not know about this and I
myself learned a lot as I Was preparing
for my course so my question is what
would you want Young American college
students know and remember about this
instant and how would you um what would
you suggest as a good approach to
introduce this topic in a constructive
way
that's great I'm going to take last
remaining questions and I'll give each
panelists chance to answer is there any
[01:30:40] other question
you had a no
go ahead
sure go ahead
no go ahead
go ahead and then I'm going to have the
panelists answer her question and say
whatever they want to say as a final
block
oh I'm Korean Association president in
Maryland and also I'm Governor Hogan's
uh commissioner in education to chair
[Music]
um
autism involved here
[01:31:12] I'm as a Korean is a I'm I'm really
interesting about the uh
I want to say about my education
background
I came I learned no it's a during time
education in the elementary school is
until finish the university I have a one
Korean president
I learned about the anti-communist
Communist whole life
[01:31:44] only for the after I graduate
then is a change to the president so
it's a my life is the only
anti-communist education
but I never heard about the first 4.3
about this I met one of my friends is
the behind the Mr Young then I learned
about that or the 4th Street
so it's available event for those um
[01:32:15] for series concert
so
oh
this is the I'm very wondering about the
America
interesting uh the America is the human
right is to insist the very hardly how
the Communist I think is the only the
community that to kill the other peoples
but how to the American soldiers can
[01:32:45] the Korean people sees the Kill by the
so this is the politically also what
what happened to the very
seriously the many Korean peoples is a
diet
how could American Military yeah
American is always the insist about the
human right
so it's a but it's the very it's a long
life is the past but they never say to
[01:33:16] the story about the Korean government
so I think it's we need I'm now is I'm
citizen
so so we must have to the Korean peoples
and we must work for the Korean and
American government to must appear sorry
to the Korean government and Korean fam
Korean for three
families
okay thank you if we don't have any or
[01:33:48] John has is it two finger yeah yeah okay
go ahead well I think she makes a very
good point there's a microphone
yes
um
I decided not to include it and
my paper which I'm gonna
talk to you about this afternoon
but um
[01:34:19] in recent years jejudo has become very
militarized
there's a big South Korean Naval Base
there
with Aegis class warships
coming in occasionally
and this is obviously
an effort by the United States and and
South Korea to have a position of
strength to project Force towards
[01:34:52] mainland China
but
one of the things
we should be worrying about looking
ahead
is not just resolving old historical
events which still are lingering but no
ones that could
pop up
like nuclear war
and South Korea is now considering
going nuclear because
[01:35:25] mostly out of peak at what North Korea
has been doing they have about a hundred
bombs worth of
nuclear material right now but we could
have another even bigger tragedy on
shajudo
if there is a nuclear war between the
two koreas and unfortunately Korea's
excuse me tejedo is going to get it if
that happens because it is a very
tempting Target
[01:35:57] and I just wanted to mention that fact
that people should consider
looking to the Here and Now
not just to resolve old historical
problems but to prevent nuance
from occurring
I'll just leave it at that
okay thank you John so if we don't have
any other question comment we'll turn to
the panelists for quick
so um
[01:36:28] so the question so I hope the students
learn to Korean modern history report
and after reparation in 1940
for five allowed to basic um
fundamental knowledge and have one to
objective approach to the conflict
Korean history including the U.S role
and many things so they can learn more
intensive knowledge to Human Rights
[01:37:01] issue through the April 3rd judge
Massacre and then I went to one more
commented chairman of gohiban
of um episode
Foundation said several months ago when
I interviewed with him for the world in
Korea English Journal so he said in
rejobing historical issue there are four
stage first fact-finding second bring
the phrase to Justice third compensation
[01:37:32] to the victims and force restoring honor
to the victims but
um in America I think education can be
start First Step yeah that is very
important
okay
thank you so we're
here from the rest of you um just
mindful of few questions that John Mill
raised his point about Americans knowing
zero I mean that's why education this is
[01:38:03] the first step and it is interesting
point about the U.S military sort of
talking to the U.S military because they
are the ones who had the operational
control
um your idea about hosting events like
this in Jeju maybe you could comment on
that that puts the 4-3 incident in a
historical perspective
um and then of course if anybody else
won't also comment on that what do we
tell the young students right and your
your comment about how can something
like this happen when U.S is so focused
on human rights and so on so we'll turn
to Dr Lee first and then Dr Young and
[01:38:34] Ambassador Steven so I have the last
word
thank you for your question and thank
you Professor for your question
um
in Academia at least we
strongly support
freedom of speech
increase into very sensitive material
including the past
and we come to acknowledge and
sympathize with the victims of mass
[01:39:04] atrocities all around the world
the fact that Jeju is primarily known is
primarily associated with attractive
images as a very nice place to visit for
the tourists for anyone and has not been
tainted
by the indelible Association of the
place of Massacre like
Nanjing
like many cities in Ukraine today
[01:39:36] milai massacre in Vietnam it's a
double-edged sword
it's good and also not so good
the fact that the rest of the world
knows so little about this subject and
Views teju as mostly a happy place is
both a good thing and also something to
ponder on further
so in the United States you know
American soldiers say in the late 19th
century massacring Filipinos
there is no denial
[01:40:08] people can have some differences of
opinion but we fully acknowledge that we
fully acknowledge that American soldiers
killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians
not only in Milan but other cities as
well
we fully acknowledge that American
soldiers tortured
Iraqis
we fully acknowledge that American
soldiers killed unjustly unlawfully
Nationals in Syria in Afghanistan but
when it comes to Jeju there is pervasive
[01:40:39] ignorance and a lack of desire for
inquiry for establishing the truth
so I think in order to encourage young
students to take interest in these
issues
perhaps try to place this particular
subject in the broad context of war
crimes or human rights violations crimes
against humanity
which raise on today in other parts of
the world but that doesn't mean that we
should not talk about this massive
episode in Korean history and in the
[01:41:12] history of U.S South Korea bilateral
relationship
the reason that Americans don't know
much about this issue is because we
don't we've not talked about it in the
public in our schools in the United
States and the fact that Americans
committed such
deeds in overseeing scorched Earth
policy burning down entire towns
killing children
[01:41:43] I guess not to defend such actions
Americans saw it perhaps necessary
led by
the misbelief the wrong view that they
were helping the South Korean forces
quell a communist Uprising throughout
the Jeju Island
it sounds somewhat absurd
to me today many years after the fact
but the containment of Communism was a
priority goal for the United States of
[01:42:14] America and in the name of quelling
communism Mass atrocities were committed
and condoned
so yeah
yeah
um
I agree I cannot agree more
before I started to study the April 3rd
I thought that human rights is utmost
importance to the U.S the U.S is a
[01:42:44] democratic country one of the leaders of
our Democratic policies but once I
started to study the April 3rd I
realized that U.S has another side
the other side that I didn't know
since the beginning of the Cold War in
that era
we have a conflict between the right and
left everything was divided into two
so to the party who is branded the
[01:43:14] Communist we had a harsh approach and
decided to crack down for the April 3rd
the US didn't try to appease the purpose
of the Jeju people they just relied on
the physical Force to crack down on the
opposition that's what they did during
the May 1st demonstration and the
answering Uprising there was a
[01:43:45] possibility that everything could be
reserved
in peace but they took the wrong path so
when we have a look at the history we
have to look at the same country can do
something right but they can do
something wrong too so from April 3rd
what we can learn there can be many
lessons that we can learn but over the
past 50 years the truth was a hidden the
buried
we just started to dig it and try to
[01:44:16] have or reveal the truth of the painful
memories
and now
by uncovering that we are starting on
the journey toward the healing and
Reconciliation
so I think that we just sat on the right
path
thank you
no I've really been very moved by so
much of what I've heard today you know
[01:44:48] do you
America
seldom lives up to its ideals
and that's not that's not only the case
in Korea or in our own country here but
throughout the world
and if there's any kind of
saving quality it's it's our democracy
if we can sustain it and by our
democracy it is our freedom of speech
not only in Academia but that in our
societies and as a government
we can look look and try to look
[01:45:19] honestly at what has happened as a free
Society engage in thinking about
what happened and what we do about it
and how we go forward but no we don't
live up to ride to ideals
um
and you know in terms of what can be
done I I say with all respect I don't
think there's any one step that the
United States or for that matter the
Korean government can take that's going
to
assuage that's going to comfort all of
[01:45:50] the pain and all the hurt and all the
wrong
um I do think it's step by step
not to say that important difficult
things cannot be done but it's step by
step and I think it's also important to
acknowledge that that is the approach
that chairman Yong and and others you
have taken
um to get this far
uh to get to a place where we can have a
conference like this where we can have
this conversation where you have the
Korean government
across the political Spectrum recognize
[01:46:20] uh that this needs to be addressed in
some way although there still may be
disagreement about what needs to be done
and so finally I guess I would say
within that context and I mean your
question's a great one what do we want
the Next Generation to know and again we
have to be realistic I mean we're all
barraged with information about history
and about about the the cruel present uh
what do we expect people to carry with
them
I welcome the fact that you're teaching
a class about the two koreas that you're
[01:46:50] looking at it and probably those
students you're training and maybe some
of them will become diplomats or go into
the military or do something else that
I I hope you're giving I'm sure you are
giving them that kind of framework to
think about this is a complicated
relationship a lot of bad stuff happened
they may not remember the details I hope
they'll remember jejudo but we they have
to come with a resolve that we have to
find a way to balance
the the human rights Dimensions uh the
the nature of American power the nature
[01:47:23] of an alliance with all of our ideals I
that's what we need our teachers for
that's what we need these things for but
I I don't take it as a measure of of you
know taking a poll of people and saying
do you know what day this happened it's
it has to be a deeper thing than that
and I do think that Jeju and the meaning
of jejudo in addition to remembering and
respecting the suffering and the TR and
the sacrifice of people there is
is to serve a larger goal and this is my
last example I said I was uh in chechito
[01:47:53] again in like 2000 I think 11 and and uh
Professor Moon Jung in was there too and
we saw a group of about 20 students from
throughout Asia in the United States
Building what they call the peace Park a
tiny little Park not the main piece Park
but a little peace park on the shore of
jejudo they spent two weeks under this
very hot sun building this little Park
it's still there I visited but what the
Jeju government then did is they invited
back every year people from this peace
Park movement
because there's a peace Park in
Vladivostok there's a peace Park in
[01:48:25] Juarez there's a peace Park in San Diego
so that kind of spirit of JeJu and if
you can get some comfort from the idea
that that Spirit of JeJu those students
went back understanding very well what
happened in Jeju but they also took with
him a sense that they need to bring
these lessons elsewhere so it is step by
step and I think we all have to be a
part of it
thank you I think that's the last word
because you just said it so beautifully
we started this conference a little late
so running about 15 minutes behind but
[01:48:56] we're now with that take a break for 10
minutes go grab coffee quick break and
then we'll regroup for panel two and
continue this conversation thank you
ladies and gentlemen we are ready to
resume our discussion with the start of
our second session
Professor Moon
is here that um oh yes okay A lot of
people are still in the hallways
[01:49:43] foreign
well thank you for joining us for our
second session I have the honor of
serving as the moderator for this panel
[01:50:14] you have again the full bios of the
speakers I'll be very brief in
introducing
Dr John Merrill
very famous old Korea hand old as in
with tradition and you know historical
records all in all senses
um for many years
Dr Merrill was the head of the state
department U.S state Department Bureau
of intelligence and research just a
small section
you were an institution by yourself Dr
[01:50:48] Merrill is an old Korea hand a true
expert a true expert on this subject as
well uh it's written The Marvelous
Journal article or two or more on the
charge of Massacre itself so we're
delighted that Dr Merrill can join us
today and then we have Dr Charles Krause
who is a deputy the deputy director at
the Wilson Center of the center's
history and public policy program Dr
[01:51:18] Krauss is an expert in various Fields
including modern Chinese history Cold
War history International history on
Urban resettlement of over 12 000
Chinese youth to xinjiang on Refugee
movement Russians to India and Beyond so
Dr Krauss we are delighted that you can
join us today to shed light on the
internet National context of the first
years of the Cold War
[01:51:49] and then third we are joined by Dr Hall
Hodgen Hall who is a reporter full-time
reporter for a major newspaper a daily
paper in South Korea called the hanjore
he is also the head of research at the
Jeju April 3rd Research Institute and he
earned his doctoral degree in political
science from Jeju National University
and wrote what sounds to me like a
fascinating topic he wrote his
[01:52:21] dissertation on a comparative study of
the chair Jews April 3rd incident and
Greek Civil War so we're delighted that
you could make the trip to be here with
us today Dr Ho before I asked John Dr
Merrill to start may I just say since I
see Ambassador Stevens uh in the back
who is still here I know you have to go
in a few minutes
I remember well first a little a little
[01:52:51] bit of self-touting bragging
when I first met Ambassador Stevens in
October 2005 at a Kei sponsored seminar
at the University of Washington she was
the luncheon speaker as the principal
Deputy assistant Secretary of State for
East Asia and Pacific Affairs she was so
dazzling I did something I've never done
before and since have not either I just
went up to her and said
[01:53:22] you are the next U.S ambassador to South
Korea
three years later my prediction came
true
and as the Ambassador when I greeted her
after some two or three years I said to
her
Madam Ambassador I feel like a prophet
like a fortune teller the more important
Point here is that the venue where I saw
Kathleen Stevens asked the sitting U.S
ambassador was in January 2009 at the
[01:53:53] kimgu Museum and library in Hilton Park
in Seoul Kimco as many of you know is a
widely respected figure as the head of
the Korean provisional government in the
Second World War
Kim Goose stood against the U.N
sponsored separate elections in South
Korea fearing that the separate election
and the separate establishment over
Korean government only in South Korea
[01:54:23] would lead to an international
Civil War
which did take place of course two years
later so Kim gu made a trip to Pyongyang
in April 2008 1948 to try
in the last minute effort to work things
over with kimizong with the North
Koreans which of course was not
successful and for that Kim gu has been
misperceived by many Americans and South
[01:54:55] Koreans as somehow anti-us which he was
not
my point here is Ambassador Stevens
visit the first ever visit by assailing
South Korean ambassador to the King
Museum and Library
made a great splash
it was reported widely by all the major
daily newspapers why because it was the
first visit by a U.S ambassador in honor
of this historical figure and it
engendered tremendous Goodwill toward
[01:55:28] the United States even among folks who
were somewhat ambivalent about the U.S
and U.S policy
so I
bring this up to try to underscore the
point any such gesture of respect a
visit by a U.S political figure
I think would be very helpful in further
raising Awareness on our issue of the
day the Jeju Massacre with that Dr
Merrill
thank you very much is this am I coming
[01:56:00] over loud and clear it says don't adjust
microphones okay so I assume I am I'm
very pleased to be with you here today
um
this is an important conference at least
for me I've been to
several of the
meetings in the series of conferences
starting
oh I don't know I was in New York I was
in several others uh maybe starting in
[01:56:30] at in chegital
at the present at the origins to borrow
a phrase
um hopefully this conference will
increase awareness of the
terrible tragedy that unfolded on
chejado
some 75 years ago
and which until now
has been
largely and conveniently forgotten
[01:57:01] by people in the United States I would
say especially conveniently forgotten by
the U.S military which is where I think
some of your
efforts should go
to get them to set the history of these
years right since I agree with speakers
in the present previous panel
that the U.S had command authority over
South Korean forces during these years
there wasn't I don't think there was
[01:57:33] even an embassy until 1948.
um
but um
they should get
some
what should I say of your ire or or your
ill feelings about the lack of
responsiveness because it was them in
the first instance that
didn't say anything about these events
[01:58:04] for so long
now having said that I have to say a
good word for the U.S military because
that's where I did most of my research
it was with unofficial researchers
clearance from the Department of the
army
so
I was here in the Washington DC area
and I just prowled around
the center for military history and
other places
to do my research
[01:58:35] and it actually wasn't until a few years
later
when I had the pleasure to go to chejado
with
Kathy Stevens that I actually visited
the island
In the Flesh so to speak
so my research was mostly book research
early on
and then I had a Fulbright
and I had finally another chance to go
to the island and spend some time there
um
[01:59:07] anyway
this is a tragedy that has been
I think
largely forgotten in the U.S and I'll
stick to my point
Kathy I don't think agrees with me but I
bet if you went somewhere in the state
department in random maybe even in front
of the career desk
and asked
can you tell me about the chejado
uprising
you probably wouldn't get too many
takers because it's been suppressed
[01:59:39] largely not talked about
and none of the underlying tension in
the region
that resulted ultimately in that tragedy
on change you know
has been resolved and as I said in the Q
a session in the previous panel
uh
we could see a tragedy unfold again on
shaded Oak because there has been
in recent years a big Naval Base
[02:00:11] built
there
years ago I taught a
course at uh
Georgetown and one of my students was
engaged
to be married
to a Korean medical doctor who was in
the Navy and that's where he was
stationed he was an oriental medical
doctor but he was stationed on Jeju
Island
and it pains me to think about
the possibility that such a beautiful
[02:00:42] lady and her husband could go up and
smoke in a nuclear attack
hope that never happens
I first became aware of the tragedy
that unfolded on shajido
after reading a short pamphlet a part of
a short pamphlet by you a wonderful guy
called David Steinberg
who used to teach at Georgetown
um
and was with the Asia Society
[02:01:15] what had happened about about changed it
was it's just a brief mention he said
this is something that has been covered
up that no one writes about and that was
a point made by several of the panelists
this morning
um it's buried history no one wants to
write about it because it's too
embarrassing to write a book
but the potential for violence
there now with nuclear weapons
is even greater and so we should I think
[02:01:47] pay more attention to the career problem
not just
the four three Uprising but the career
problem more generally because
it could come back to haunt us
uh
when I started out there was and this is
something that Steinberg said that was
almost nothing written about chejado in
English
uh it was even more so the case in
[02:02:18] Korean
as we heard from several speakers this
morning
until recently discussion of chejado was
banned
under the National Security Act
you couldn't write about it it was a
verbot subject
and uh
I had to watch myself when I got in
landed in Korea on a Fulbright
to make sure that
the government knew what I was doing
and I was warned on my first day
[02:02:51] I the Fulbright staff told me stories
about a previous fulbrighter the
previous year
who had been out drinking with friends
in a bar
and was Loosely talking about the love
life of Pak Chung hee
and someone was listening in on the
conversation unbeknownst to him and he
was asked within a week
to get the hell out of the country and
fortunately they were able to find a
place for him in the Fulbright program
in Japan and so he made out okay
[02:03:24] but I was
forewarned
uh
change it I want to make a point that's
I think an important point and that
hasn't been made enough this morning or
today
Judo was not unique
that may sound a strange like a strange
thing to say
but
I've written
[02:03:56] all my professional life about jejudo
and other events in Korea but we have to
look at it in a broader compass
jejudo was one of a series of tragedies
that unfolded
throughout East Asia
as former Colonial Powers sought to
reimpose Colonial structures
in the aftermath of World War II
so you just look at a broad swath of
[02:04:27] East Asia and you can see this
um
you've got Korea you've got uh
Taiwan
where the common tongue
tried to Massacre it largely succeeded
most of the indigenous leadership of the
island around the same time that the
chegeot uprising occurred and it
happened in Southeast Asia too
now I haven't studied these uprisings
[02:04:57] and I haven't tried to look at it in
historical perspective but I think
that's a very important subject for
research
going forward
chejdo was not unique
it was part of a pattern and I think we
can learn something about the change
into uprising by viewing it in that
context
as part of a broader pattern
[02:05:32] and the pattern was that you had local
populations that had been this is I'm
going to use some political science
jargon here because I'm political
scientist I are you political scientist
or historian crypto historian crypto
historian
well
local populations had been mobilized
to use Sam Huntington's word that is
politically activated
by the defeat of Japan
and that's why they resisted so strongly
[02:06:04] the attempt to reimpose Colonial
structures after the war
but not just in charge everywhere
um
at first this may seem strange to say
the U.S military government got on
pretty well
with the
local government on the island which was
of course the people's committee
because initially they tried to
manage things with a very light hand
[02:06:37] but later as they
pressed down more strongly some of these
problems arose
and I think there's some good research
that possibly could be done about the
different approaches of the military
government on the island and the
occupation on the island
I I'm I don't know enough about this to
to say too much more but I I think there
were differences important once
there was an error of good feeling that
[02:07:09] pervaded initially
but it dissipated
very quickly as the Cold War
reality sank in and the U.S
authorities became more concerned with
control
than they had been previously
the Sarah of Good Feelings ended
and control became the Paramount goal
one of the things that caused this I
[02:07:39] think was the
so-called October people's uprising
in October of
1946 I believe it was
um
as Korea began to be caught up in the
Maelstrom of the Cold War The Wider Cold
War
the strategy that the military
government then adopted and U.S advisors
adopted and this was referred to
[02:08:13] this morning or earlier this afternoon
was one of area clearance
the Chinese had a nice phrase for it the
three alls
campaign referring to the Japanese but
all this all of the South Korean
Military Officers at this time which is
another problem
were Veterans of the Japanese Army
veterans officers in the Japanese Army
and their approach was
[02:08:45] as I say area Clarence
and to
establish refugee camps along the coast
of the island and try to relocate the
entire population there and the interior
of the island
which by the way if you've never had a
chance to visit is astoundingly
beautiful
uh was to
burn all kill all destroy all anyone who
[02:09:17] the military encountered this were were
talking by when I say the military and
this is a very complicated story which
may be in a q a session
we can get into
was initially a constabulary force
not a a military until after the
Republic of Korea was founded
um
but the idea was to cordon off the
interior of the island
[02:09:48] and then do sweeps
and anyone who was caught in the sweeps
was presumed to be an enemy
and was killed it was a free fire zone
that's the reality
and you could I don't know how it is now
but until a few a few years ago you
could see ruins plenty of ruins of
destroyed villages on the slopes of
montala if you've ever been to Che Judo
you know that
the two important mountains in Korea one
[02:10:20] is Hala and one aspective uh
and we almost had a summit a few years
ago but it never happened
because the symbol the symbolism was too
too good
any anybody I should say that uh Kim
jong-un's mother
was from the co-family clan I believe
and so initially he was a jejudoer
and the the symbolism of this would
[02:10:50] would have been beautiful
the two highest peaks in Korea
but it never happened
I was working I think at the state
department at that time and I was hoping
it would happen never did
um
U.S military advisers were present
throughout all operations most of mostly
all
military operations on the island and
they did approve of this General
strategy of area clearance they may not
[02:11:23] have approved of the particular way in
which it was implemented by a gung-ho
South Korean military but but they they
were in charge and they should have
known
they should have exercised oversight on
that
there were also two U.S
Naval Destroyers
cruising the coast
off of chejado at various periods during
[02:11:53] the Rebellion
to make sure that the rebels did not
receive any supplies or reinforcements
from the mainland
and the gravaman the main charge
against
the leader of the namlo dang faction in
the Korean labor party
was
originally
that he encouraged
[02:12:23] I
adventurous charge into the teeth of
American Military bayonets
on shajido
and led the namlo dang into a suicidal
charge
which I suppose I don't know about
whether he couldn't be held responsible
but
let's Maybe
what happened
I tend to
think that there's more spontaneity than
planning
in the uprising in the sense as I said
[02:12:56] as I told you a minute ago this this was
if you look at this in Broad perspective
this was one of many popular resistance
movements in the aftermath of World War
II
so I don't know how planned it was
there must have been some Mastermind in
Moscow I guess who was planning the
kmt's massacre
uh I'm I'm being
cynical here on uh on Taiwan but anyway
[02:13:27] I I think the North Korean charge
after the war when Pak hanyon was purged
is largely correct he did for one reason
or another he did lead a charge an
adventurous charge into the teeth of
American bayonets
uh
now I think it's important to say we
only touched on it very briefly in
discussion in previous sections
[02:13:58] uh
the the very same potential for violence
exists
today
on Che Judo as it did then
and you have a huge South Korean Naval
Base
which makes a big Target for North
Korean nuclear weapons if the balloon
ever goes up if it ever comes to that
so this is not just a historical
conference
and it should be something that
[02:14:29] energizes the United States government
to take the problem
of Korean unification a little bit more
seriously than it has before Oh I know
you can look it up on you can Google it
there's some wonderful press release
that says we have a policy that
has this that and other components but
in fact not a goddamn thing has been
done
about the Korean problem in this
[02:14:59] Administration
and little was done in the previous
administration
except
high profile
Trump exercises and personal diplomacy
with his buddy Kim Jong-un
but I hope we can get something going
again
it stands to reason that
Kim's mother was from the co clan
one of the big family groupings
[02:15:33] and it stands to reason that probably he
learned something about what had
happened there
from his mum
in his early years
and let's hope
I got one minute left and I'm finished
growing up
so that's all I have to say anything
else will have to be in the Q a session
thank you
Kim jong-un's mother was actually born
in Osaka Japan yes
[02:16:04] his his uh I think he was a
he worked in a textile factory making
Japanese uniforms for the military yeah
yes
thank you
you know your history pretty well
thanks
great
um thank you so much to Dr Sue Terry and
to Dr Lee as well as oh I forgot that so
this goes for me too yes on the on the
behalf of the panel uh thanks to Sue and
[02:16:34] to Dr Lee and the uh the peace
foundation in Walden Korea uh for
inviting us to take part in this
conversation
and I should also say it's fairly
intimidating for me to follow in the
footsteps of so many distinguished
experts on the history of Korea as well
as uh sorry on the cheju Rebellion as
well as those with a family connection
to this history uh and other personal
connections
so when preparing for my remarks today I
[02:17:05] did something maybe a little unusual I
went back and read a paper I wrote many
years ago as an undergraduate student
that partially dealt with the Jeju
uprising
um at that time I had the Good Fortune
of taking a class with a professor named
Adam Cathcart who asked me to write a
research paper about the origins of the
Korean War
and cheju didn't have to be a part of
the paper but as I did the research uh
and learned more about it I found you
know this this history so
[02:17:36] um compelling and distressing that cheju
did become a part of this this research
paper
um and there's a reason I mentioned this
and I think based on some of the
discussion we've heard earlier today
about how do we how do we get people to
remember or to even know that this
episode ever took place we talked about
teaching and students and I suppose I'm
a good example of what that can
accomplish because I've internalized the
history I remember the che Judo uprising
[02:18:09] I should also say that my paper that I
wrote 15 years ago or more was littered
with references to the work of John
Merrill which shows just how influential
his writing on this history is choose
another word
I'm littered
um but for the the purposes of of today
I wanted to to not really make a
coherent presentation or discussion of
the che Judo Uprising but really to to
[02:18:39] highlight some of the themes layers
legacies of the history that that appeal
to me
and um
and before I dive in I do want to just
acknowledge that you know when we talk
about Jeju
um you know we have to appreciate people
that this was something that really uh
deeply affected thousands and thousands
of people and continues to affect uh
many people today even though we're so
far removed from this this episode
[02:19:10] um you know Jeju involved people who
made choices
um about whether to Rebel about whether
to employ violent tactics to suppress a
rebellion
uh about people who maybe wish to just
be bystanders uh but ended up becoming
victims
but we also need to understand the
structures and the conditions that
condition uh that condition these human
choices that shape those human choices
and I'll try to be quick
[02:19:41] um I think one of those conditions that
we have to be mindful about was the the
history and Legacies of the Japanese
colonization of Korea which had a
tremendous impact on cheju island in
terms of people coming and going uh
about the economy of the island about
the militarization of the island the
presence of Japanese weapons military
installations and so forth
um so this shaped and especially the the
collapse of the Japanese empire this
really did shape uh the social
[02:20:12] environment on the island that was one
factor and and what eventually took
place
we also have to be mindful of the fact
that in many ways the United States and
as Dr Merrill hinted the South Korean
army did come to embody a colonial
presence on the island in many ways it
could seem as if for the people of Jeju
Island that they had had one Colonial
Master Japan that had suddenly been
replaced by another uh the United States
with its South Korean allies
[02:20:44] yeah
the great Powers also can just condition
the choices available to the peoples of
JeJu and specifically I'm referring to
the failure of great power diplomacy
when it came to reaching any sort of
consensus or conclusion about the future
of Korea
many authors say the April 3rd 1948
Uprising was most directly a consequence
of the decision to hold separate
elections in South Korea which
effectively cemented the division
[02:21:15] between North and South
so how did we get to separate elections
which then may have helped to
precipitate the uprising
um as we all know after World War II the
United States and the Soviet Union each
granted themselves control over one half
of Korean territory
which was meant to be a temporary
measure until the Allied Powers worked
out the particulars of Korea's
Independence
in December 1945 the two countries moved
[02:21:47] forward on This Promise by reaching the
so-called Moscow agreement which formed
a joint commission which had the
responsibility to again deliver on This
Promise of Korean Independence
uh of course the U.S Soviet Joint
Commission deadlocked not once but twice
over the next two years
and as it deadlocked uh negotiations
between the United States and the Soviet
Union
began to proceed on two parallel levels
one was this joint commission the other
[02:22:18] was direct exchanges between the Soviet
foreign minister and the U.S Secretary
of State
and if you read the correspondences
between these officials it's a it's
really a case study in passive
aggressive diplomacy uh there was
clearly no will on either side
to compromise or to uh to really live up
to their promise
and the breaking point as we've heard
came in September 1947 when the United
States announced that it would jettison
[02:22:49] the joint commission
and instead of bilateral talks with the
Soviet Union it would turn the issue
over to the United Nations
uh so the United States uh as we've I
think Dr Lee was hinting earlier about
this
um has quite a bit of blame to share for
this
the Soviet Union for its part really
refused this initiative on the part of
the United States it put forward its own
competing resolution at the UN which
failed the United states-led initiative
[02:23:21] passed and then we know what the rest is
history that the Soviets and its allies
both within Korea and elsewhere refused
to participate in these U.N held
elections and we get the emergence of a
separate South Korean government thanks
to the elections held in May 1948
and to be sure you know Koreans of all
political Stripes uh shaped what the
United States and the Soviet Union could
and could not do I mean a lot of the
diplomacy that was going on between the
[02:23:52] two countries was determined by what
Koreans were doing uh and saying
um but I think we can safely say that
Jeju was a consequence of Soviet and
American misdeeds and that it was a
byproduct of the Soviet American Cold
War
uh Chichi was a tragedy in itself but it
was also a predictor of things to come
and here I'm referring obviously to the
Korean War
[02:24:22] to follow up on something that John said
there is no evidence that I've ever seen
that North Korea had really anything to
do to change you Uprising uh although
the you know the South Korean labor
party would have been favorable uh to
North Korea's political positions
um but Jeju what Jeju was an intriguing
moment for Kim il-sung and the North
Korean leadership
and Kim il-sung certainly followed news
of cheju closely
uh at an inter-korean meeting in July
[02:24:54] 1948 for example
uh which was held as sort of a protest
of the U.N elections uh the North
Koreans highlighted uh what happened in
cheiju as a an example of popular
protest against the South Korean regime
um
after one of the leaders of the cheju
uprising Kim Dawson escaped to North
Korea the dprk showered him with praise
for quote heroically resisting the South
[02:25:24] Korean Armed Forces
uh and in a September 1949 cable to
Joseph Stalin one of Kim il-sung's uh
interlocutors highlighted that well
South Koreans were successful uh the
South Korean government was successful
in quelling uh the uprising on Jeju
unrest was spreading across South Korea
and partisans were becoming increasingly
active in the southern half of the
peninsula
and this is important because partisans
and the idea that there would be a
[02:25:55] popular Uprising in South Korea was one
of the primary ways that Kim il-sung
sold the Korean War to Joseph Stalin and
Mao Zedong he claimed that as soon as
North Korean troops crossed the 38th
parallel a popular Uprising would follow
and the which would lead to unification
on North Korea's terms
and could I interject something yeah
years ago I looked at the original
[02:26:25] transcript not the published version
of khrushchev's memoirs
and uh
khrushchev's described the situation
apropos what you just said
as being an overheated
balloon full of revolutionary fervor
which was ready to explode if it was
just pricked
with the pin it would blow up so I think
that's what's Stalin may have thought he
[02:26:57] was getting into yeah the Korean War and
of course that's not what happened
um uh so just as well you know I I guess
my point was Kim Wilson
drew a lesson from Jeju which uh
encouraged him to want to launch an
invasion he could have just as well
drawn a negative lesson which was the
United States and South Korea would do
whatever it took to suppress these types
of uprisings
um lastly I think a a theme I wanted to
[02:27:29] highlight is a relationship between
cheju and how we
um this is a historic historian's term
uh periodize the Korean War which means
you know basically when did the Korean
War begin
and uh there's a very well-known
military historian who's written a lot
about the Korean War Alan Millet and he
says quite simply that the Korean War
Began on April 3rd 1948.
and I think if you read The Works of
John Merrill Peninsular origins of the
[02:28:01] war or Bruce Cummings you may come away
with a similar
um conclusion
um well what are the implications of
saying the War Began on April 3rd 1948.
you know we in in the United States at
least we often say that it began on June
25th 1950. what happened then
North Korea with the backing of the
Soviet Union in China invaded South
Korea and that's the conventional
interpretation very neat and clean when
did the war start who was responsible
[02:28:33] um but if we back date the start of the
Korean War to 1948
we're reminded that the Korean war was
its heart at its heart a civil war
um that although the division between
North and South Korea was artificial and
imposed upon it from outside actors uh
that Korean Society was deeply fractured
within the two respective Korean States
at the very least chechu was a sneak
preview of what was to come it was an
extraordinarily violent destructive
Conflict waged by Koreans of
[02:29:05] diametrically opposed politics
one that caused extreme social
dislocation
hardship trauma
and invited outside intervention and
participation from Americans Russians
and Chinese
now I have no expectation that anyone in
the broader public will start to say
that the Korean War Began on April 3rd
1948.
but I do think this can be a useful uh
strategy particularly in the context of
of a classroom setting
[02:29:37] to get people to think critically about
the causes of the Korean War
um yes the character and the scope of
the conflict changed dramatically on
June 25th 1950
but there was an important chapter or
chapters before this and cheju can
remind us that again the Korean war was
its at its heart a civil war
um
I will stop there in the interest of
time
and save any other comments for the the
Q a but thank you thank you very much Dr
[02:30:09] Krause
[Applause]
hello this is my great honor to
make a project
make a presentation about children like
about
this Center in Washington
Asia journalist and a researcher for
studying firstly incident
my main interest is the relations
[02:30:40] between America and Jeju incident
so I'll focus on that matter
uh I read my prepared paper
I think pure Americans have understood
the title of the today's presentation to
incident in America
even many Americans maybe ask what is
the relations between America and Jeju
Force the incident
over 70 years ago 25
000 to 30 000 Islanders were 10 percent
[02:31:13] of the Jewish population
were killed during the treasure incident
or operating
most of the victims were
killed by government forces
so
yes
yes third
this image is uh firstly incident
investigation report published by the
Korean government in 2003
[02:31:44] the reporter stated the commanding
officers of the Korean regiment during
the sketchedules policy are responsible
for the killings and the final
responsibility for the president
this report also remarked that the U.S
military government and the U.S Advisory
Group cannot be free from responsibility
during the occurrency and separation of
Jesus Hasan
today I would like to talk about the
[02:32:15] role of U.S military government during
the treasury incident through documents
produced by the U.S military and
officials
liberated from the Japanese colonial
rule as you know South Korea was on the
military government by the U.S army from
September 1945 to August to 1948 when
the South Korean government was
established
and I'm the uprising by judge branch of
[02:32:46] a South Korean labor party broke out on
April 3
1948. in the early stage of the uprising
U.S military governor in South Korea at
the time Major General William F Dean
gave instructions for the Korean Coast
Guard and the constability to carry out
a joint operation
um
uh please please look at this Imaging
General Dean cable the lieutenant
[02:33:18] colonel Mansfield of Jesus military
government company to use the Korean
constability at your at your disposal to
eliminate the subversible elements on
change your law
late April Commanding General of U.S
forces in Korea Lieutenant General
he's the Supreme Commander in southern
Korea at the time
inform the poor instructions to
[02:33:50] Mansfield interview for handling of the
treasury situation
like this
one of the four instructions was the
constability was so was to immediately
play a role
and another was then was that the U.S
military would not be involved
and after that General Dean and Orlando
the Commanding General level six
division in panjou visit each together
[02:34:20] to assess the situation they flew over
the mountainous area when the
constability was surrounding Villages
and arresting all males aged over 18.
six days later this time General Dean
accompanied by Korean officials busy
teacher Island again and held the
emergency meeting
this day was the five days before the
May 10 general election
but Church Island became the only area
[02:34:52] where the elections failed the military
government has increased the intensity
of the Crackdown the punitive operations
carried out the under military
government leadership reached their Peak
with the this page of the corner
Roseville Brown of the sixth division
he was the Supreme Commander directing
the operations not only of U.S advisors
but also the Korea constability for this
and the police stationed on the island
[02:35:22] orders for the military government
company on Jeju and the Jeju
U.S army County intelligence Corps
Support Connor Brown through all
available means
browse it is purchased stood in contrast
with the attitude shown early on in the
uprising with the orders at the time for
the U.S military to not allow itself to
be seen
while U.S advisors in Greece did not
present in the operation area
[02:35:54] during the Greek Civil War
u.sport U.S army colonel commanded the
ownership Island
I'm sorry
yes this is the Korean newspapers at
that time
they reported that U.S military the
carnations aircraft took the Skies over
[02:36:25] Jeju while U.S Jeeps commanded the
combat on the front lines and U.S
warships constantly belched black smoke
as They Carried the nearby Waters
Connor Brown
told the reporters Korean reporters in
Treasure Island I am not interested in
the causes of the incident my mission is
to clamp down
my mission is only to suppress
[02:36:57] on the bronze command the Korea
constabulary began on indiscriminate
arrest campaign
residents who had fled to the Upland
areas were regarded as a communists and
riotus
around 5 000 residents were arrested in
over a month
even after the government was
established on August 15 1948
United States continued to exercise
considerable influence on the South
Korean military under the Korea U.S
[02:37:27] agreement
based on that agreement the provisional
military Advisory Group so-called Pima
was organized with a brigade General
William Roberts as its Chief and assumed
operational control for the South Korean
Armed Forces
by October 1948 the gorilla groups
became more aggressive in their attacks
on the police
they did not attack the Guerrilla groups
did not attack the
military or U.S troops
[02:37:58] they only attacked the police
Angel response Korea constabulary
launched the scratched Earth policy
the ninth regimental command on Jesus
Island issued a decree that anyone La
trespass anywhere further than five
kilometers from the coast
and violet is violators will be shot
due to lack of transportation and
communication however the degree was not
properly related to the Upland villages
and residents who were classified as
[02:38:30] rioters and Communists were obliged to
flee into the hills or caves for their
very survival
with large-scale punitive operations
taking place residents who are given
summary trials were captured by Korean
constability police and extreme rightist
groups
the casualties of Jewish people were
concentrated from November 1948 to March
1949.
[02:39:01] there were times where more than 100
people were slaughtered in one day
yes this this shows that John mucho
the special representative of American
Vision in Korea called armik later
became the first U.S ambassador in Korea
voiced the concerns about the South
[02:39:32] Korean militaries inabilities to root
out Jesus Island communists you know
cable to the state department on
November at the time as I said it's
scratched us
there are scratched Us in Jeju Island
finally the regimental Commander
declared the martial law by the approval
of the president
martial article declaration not only
restricted civil rights but also served
to justify civilians
Mascus
[02:40:06] AGC U.S advisors also made active use of
the extreme rightists and those who has
the youth league
to be constability and the police in
Jeju Island you see that
commended by several American officers
meanwhile the tragic situation that were
taking place on Jeju would not be
reported outside the island as the
government and Armed Forces control the
Press but the U.S advisor and Jesus
attended the regular stem meeting of the
[02:40:38] Korean constability and knew the
killings
he reported the regiment daily
activities to seouls headquarters
yes on 18 December 1948 when Jojo Island
was destroyed to the HCG General Roberts
recommended to Korean prime minister in
his letter their nice regiment
Commander's activities be largely
publicized by Media Radio and
[02:41:10] presidential statement any reply Korea
defense Ministry Chief of Staff sent to
General Roberts a letter stating that
regimental commander and the U.S army
advisor had shown fine capabilities on
Jeju Island that he would recommend the
announcement of a presidential statement
General rabaji perceptions of Jesus
situation both rationalized and
increased killings
under the civilian massacres were
occurred continuously the high-ranking
official
average counselor as I know counselor
[02:41:44] about a drum writer of American Vision
in Korea sent a letter to General
Robertson March 10
1949 concerning the situation of JeJu in
his letter he wrote
the situation on Treasury island is
pretty serious dead and there's some
rather positive action will have to be
taken to ameliorate the situation there
you know reply the following day Robert
impounded from right dead she had
recently sent her a strong letter to the
Prime Minister and then had a copy sent
[02:42:15] to the president on the island Gary line
military situation there
Amanda
Amanda which occurred the state
department the Treasure Island was
chosen as the spot for a major Soviet
effort to sue confusion and Terror in
South Korea and it seems obvious that
Soviet agents are being filtered into
Jeju without difficulty
but but there is no evidence that the
[02:42:48] Soviet involvement in Jesus situation
it can be said that these reports had a
driven Treasure Island to the scene of
the confrontation of the Cold War
even after the successful redo election
on May 10 1949 Mexico was still being
committed in the name of eradicating
communist Communists on October 2 on
October
1949
249 people were executed according to
court martial decisions with the
[02:43:18] approval of the president
but the newspaper didn't even report a
single line of this terrible Mass
execution
but U.S advisors knew the situation
accurately and reported that to the
headquarters
in the same month
in the same month Ambassador Mutual
reported to the state department that
she was glad to be able to report that
operation was so devastatingly
[02:43:49] successful
sent to the state department by Army
American Vision in Korea include the
phrases including agile status
interested or agile state is aware
that shows that information on Jesus
incident towards being continuously
deported to the Department
even after the Korean war broke out the
United States showed a continuing
interest in clinical activity on Jeju
Island and proposed the measures to
[02:44:20] clearly many of which were taken up by
the South Korean government and Armed
Forces now I finished my presentation I
can't say everything about Jesu firstly
of rising in 15 minutes
we need to we need to join to research
and find the document more
after the democratization movement in
South Korea in the late 1980s
the Jesus effect finding movement was
launched and for the past 30 years
[02:44:53] research on the role of America in the
jail Uprising have been conducted in
Korea
after World War II many research has
been done on the U.S intervention during
the Greek Civil War
however the academic and political
circles in the America in America did
not seem to be interested in charge of
rising so far
a case in which the U.S directly will
indirectly intervened in an incident in
a small region such as Jeju Island is
[02:45:24] extremely unusual since World War II
Jeju Island had changed from the ages to
the most prosperous tourist place in
South Korea Island which attracted more
than 13 million tourists a year has
become the hottest place where the South
Koreans want to go sizing the most
next year marks the 75th anniversary of
change firstly incident many people many
people would attend the memorial service
I hope the American
[02:45:55] officials attend the
service
we must strive for the universal values
of peace and human rights
the famous Holocaust Memorial Hall in
Washington was built for that purpose
and the visitors try not to forget the
pest
I believe the Korea U.S relations are
strengthened through a deep
understanding of the tragic events of
the pest thank you for listening
thank you
[02:46:29] I think the what seemed like endless
rows and Columns of crosses on unmarked
graves in honor of the nameless victims
at the chezu peace Park and Museum
is
you know this the solemnity of the
landscape
reflects I think
the prolonged silence
[02:47:00] the coerced silence and the prolonged
Agony of the families of the victims
and I mentioned this just to make the
point that on your next visit to Jeju
for fun I hope
please you know consider visiting the
museum and the park it's very Grand it's
very moving
so
well we'll open up the floor to any
questions I'm sure we are not all
experts so if you have any doubts or
[02:47:30] some something that's unclear to you
please gentlemen in the back and then
gentlemen with the tie in the
um behind if you would if you would
kindly state your name and affiliation
if any uh John Burton I'm a Washington
columnist for the Korea times
um it was the uprising in any way could
it also be considered an issue of
regional autonomy because it was my
impression that uh trade you the people
[02:48:00] on Che Judo had always historically had
a sense of Independence I believe it was
also a place of political Exile under
the E uh Dynasty
um so did is this not just a ideological
conflict but rather a regional one as
well and I my second question is how
much American
U.S meter reporting was going on
contemporary media reporting was gone uh
[02:48:33] going on uh during this period because
it would seem to me that would explain
the lack of knowledge about this in the
U.S
would anyone like to take up on this
I can respond to the second part and
just very quickly and say it was it was
reported on in the U.S media uh quite a
bit I think in the New York Times
um so it's not that it was unknown but
it was in the media
[02:49:06] yeah
John
Mr Jones
you said it's an internal Independence
autonomy in the region that was your
question some researchers say that some
of them argue that it can be seen and as
the regional autonomy like you pointed
it out because as we discussed before we
[02:49:37] have this extreme right wing youth group
called
the Northwest Youth Group they did the
horrible things in in Jeju they did they
did all these high-handed activities and
brutal activities against the judge
people it was a protest against that
brutality and one person in the strike
said that
they claim that they had no choice
[02:50:10] being killed doing by nothing or doing
something and they will they'll be
killed anyway because they have the
police and they have this right-wing
extremists
youth group because as a young Native
person in Jeju they said they cannot
turn a blind eye to the audio atrocities
done against their own people so yes it
can be interpreted as some kind of a
struggle for the regional autonomy and
as Mr Krause mentioned yeah Los Angeles
[02:50:44] Times and use the Christian Science
monitor in New York Times there were
reports
The Source was only one single Source
they
they never ran to the coverage in the on
the field
they they refer to this as one source
the report by the U.S military
government
so
the report
99.9 percent
all the coverage in the U.S
[02:51:14] was biased
so
they only
reported what the U.S military achieved
not the killings on the Jeju people
likes to translate with few
embellishments perhaps an addition of my
own views as well
in the context of your question did
jeju's history of autonomy
have an impact
[02:51:45] many scholars think yes
the traditional relative autonomy
enjoyed by the Islanders was a factor in
shaping the following view the
interventions by the extreme right-wing
group called Northwest Youth League
which were violent thugs basically and
the pillaging and the crimes committed
against the people of JeJu for over
months did impel Jeju Islanders to feel
[02:52:19] this is a matter of survival although we
just sit here and do nothing and die or
we die standing up and fighting
resisting so there is that historical
Narrative of a struggle to protect the
autonomy and the lives and the
livelihoods of the people of JeJu with
respect to your second question yes
there were media reports foreign reports
of what happened but they all relied on
[02:52:50] the U.S army military government in
Korea reports so there was no
independent investigative reporting but
the same narrative told repeated by
these foreign journalists
I would also add
that there
were rebellions at the end of the E
Dynasty
on chejado
very serious ones
and so again the remoteness of the
[02:53:23] island
there was this tension between central
control
and local autonomy which was a factor as
well
but as you said John for a while the
military government the U.S government
and the Jeju Island people's committee
got along very well
yeah
but then as the military took all not
all but more than half of the the
harvest rice away from the island severe
[02:53:54] food shortage the outbreak of Cholera
and all kinds of you know infectious
diseases and privations led to the
souring of the relationship
young man in the back with a high
handsome tie
thank you for today's talk my name is
doyong I'm a second year Master's
student from the Fletcher School of Law
and diplomacy I'm currently studying
under Dr Lee in Korea class today my
first question goes to Dr Mel you today
[02:54:26] you briefly mentioned that Jeju April
3rd incident is part of the grand
pattern that persisted in Asia in 1900s
then if so why do you think Jeju
incident
gains less attention relatively to other
major incidents that happened in Asia
and my second question is seeing what's
happening in Ukraine also in Burma and
China too seems like such human rights
atrocities still persist in today and
Mankind never learns a lesson from the
[02:54:58] history so what drives such events and
what should be done to prevent such
events thank you
wow
um
I'm not so sure that the mainstream
narrative on what's happening in the
Ukraine
is correct
I don't know
but I think we may have been sold
a bill of goods
[02:55:29] by the zielinski government
and the Biden Administration on what's
going on
I can't prove it it's just a feeling
and I'm not defending anything that the
Russians have done
but uh
it just seems fishy to me
many things just don't add up
what was the other question so that's
that's what I have to say about
[02:55:59] pardon me
why the U.S taxpayer should send
billions of literally now billions of
dollars
to support zielinski
and we know from news reports
that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt
governments in the world
where is all this money going who's
doing an audit of it
[02:56:29] it just doesn't make sense to me
anyway that's just a personal feeling I
haven't studied it I can't prove any of
this
well coming back to change what was the
first part of the question first
question
so
so you briefly mentioned during your
remark that Trader incident is part of
this Grand pattern yes system in Asia
what makes Trader incident gaining less
attention to other major events that
happened in Asia I haven't I haven't
studied that it's that's a question for
[02:57:02] you I mean I maybe it's cliche it's
cliche
um but everyone knows in the United
States we call the Korean War The
Forgotten War
whether it's truly forgotten or not
that's debatable
um but if if we accept that at face
value that the Korean war is the
Forgotten War well this is a forgotten
chapter in a forgotten War
um
whereas you know I think you know other
man you know if you look at sort of
Vietnam War massacres
[02:57:32] which uh if you if you look at what was
going on in U.S domestic Society at that
time uh with the peace movement and
where people were really really invested
in this conflict of of course they're
going to pay attention to the different
massacres that took place in Vietnam
um but I mean it's
why do we remember one thing why do we
forget another I mean that's that's a
really complicated question and I don't
know that anyone will ever be able to
give an answer
[02:58:02] um and you know the same goes for your
your second question I mean
if anyone tells you they have a an
answer they're they're selling you
selling you something
um I I would probably go back to what
Ambassador uh Stevens had said earlier
which was you know the U.S has ideals we
don't always live up to them but uh
usually we eventually uh will at least
acknowledge that we didn't live up to
them
in some of the countries you you
mentioned China Burma Russia
[02:58:34] I don't know that they those governments
uh are inspired by the same sets of
ideals and it's not a surprise to me
that they might repeat some of these
tragic mistakes
you know you could I think
the Northwest Youth Association is a
very good point
they were a proxy
it wasn't the U.S military it wasn't the
South Korean constabulary we
subcontracted the dirty work out to them
[02:59:04] and they did it
very well from a military standpoint on
chejado
so in a way
it's like
the way that we dealt later with
Insurgent movements in the third world
um
it's a dirty business
and we didn't want to be directly
involved
[02:59:38] are you as for your question is gaining
less attention why now
the Korean War you said it's a forgotten
where in the U.S you mentioned it the
Jeju 4-3 is a forgotten it's not a
forgotten instant it was a tabood
incident during these uh dictatorships
and Military it was a forbidden history
in Korea and just just mentioning that
would take a lot of courage and many
[03:00:10] people had to go through so much
suffering just mentioning that the
Taiwan 2.8 is the same thing in the
Northeast Asia the Democratic movement
and the father was happening and since
1980s the Democratic movement in the
1980s that's just that's how we defect
finding into the j243 strident and the
the case in Taiwan also went to the same
path as Dr John Mariel mentioned the
[03:00:44] northwest
said it's not messed on mind
well I think Northwest is the
independent and it was Mastermind
and as I showed you earlier in the paper
it was recommended encouraged by the U.S
military
and the local authorities and the recent
Administration and the police and
constability
mobilized he said it was Mastermind
[03:01:16] okay
[Music]
youth associations like the Northwest
Youth Association that's a theme that
you can see
in some we are already five minutes four
minutes behind schedule okay I'll shut
up I got one more sense to say with some
of the wet work that has been
subcontracted out pardon me so over the
[03:01:50] years
by the CIA
same pattern
we don't do the Dirty Work ourselves
um
[03:02:34] [Music]
[Music]
[03:03:34] the question is have you come across in
your research any indication or explicit
statements of racism toward the Korean
people exhibited by the Americans and
was that a factor in facilitating the
rampant suppression and killings well
all I can say about that is my late wife
was Korean
and her father was a Korean military
veteran
and he's buried in a military cemetery
down near Tejon so I don't think the
[03:04:08] racism angle
holds water
for a total explanation of what the U.S
did partially Maybe
I mean I wouldn't
um I would hesitate to to um
I guess to stereotype all of American
officials and military officials who
were involved
in Korea at that time but I do think and
I'm not saying I'm not drawing a
connection between the suppression of
[03:04:40] cheju and these sorts of attitudes but I
do think it was quite widespread at that
time
amongst high-level leaders to to believe
that Korea Koreans maybe weren't ready
for Independence
um I I think you can find a lot of
examples of that even as the United
States government as official policy was
trying to move work with the Soviet
Union to achieve Korean Independence
at the same time informally you have
[03:05:10] people like Douglas MacArthur or um uh
General Hodge
saying fairly derisive things about
Koreans and um
it's an unfortunate reflection of that
era where you have a western power come
in and think they know better without
really probably trying to understand the
people in the culture
well
yes and no
so you have you have a a point in some
[03:05:43] cases
it depends
a lot of Americans go to Korean they
love the place
I would love I think I'm too old anymore
to
hobble off a plane on Jeju
and go enjoy myself in one of the big
hotels but I'd love to do that
um
so I wouldn't over generalize
basically is what I'm saying
[03:06:13] finally
time to end no I'm going to abuse my
prerogatives as the moderator possibly
in violation of Wilson Center rules and
pick on somebody in the audience and ask
that person a question who's in the
audience Hanson
as the youngest party member of the
Korean Workers Party
of Korea North Korea
in your studies and career in North
Korea did you ever hear about the
[03:06:43] treasure uprising because I would think
Kimmy song Kim Jong-un might be a bit
sensitive about talking about people's
Uprising ah yeah thanks for asking Dr
Lee fellow at Global Peace Foundation
extremely intelligent pundit sought
after advisor to the US government
thank you for this amazing you know
events I learned a lot today I mean I
absolutely have no idea what was going
on in 19 you know 50 before
[03:07:16] um so I do learned I did learn about the
Jesus incident very briefly in my
history class and political class when I
was in North Korea but they didn't
mention any you know
involvement of North Korea and like
people just
I think I always thought that people
just wanna like a liberal democracy and
avoid oppression by the military
[03:07:47] government from
I mean the U.S military governments
that's what I taught so
um they deny any involvement
um that's not too bad
because they want to blame
to U.S government and then president
Somali so that's the logic I guess I you
know learned well I I kind of agree with
that interpretation
well thank you there's some subtext
I just want to mention we have a
[03:08:19] reception waiting for us we have a
reception yes
now there's some subtext here uh
uh one of them is
this conflict
within the North Korean leadership
between
and Kim il-sung
's Purge and the criticism that he led
an adventurous charge into the teeth of
American bayonets I don't know that
[03:08:51] chejado was mentioned but I assumed
when I've read that that was what the
reference was to can you
give me your opinion
it's very short yep thank you
yeah uh the charges against
the head of the non-nodong faction in
the South Korean in the
yeah in the Korean Workers Party was
[03:09:21] that he had led an adventurous charge
into the teeth
of American bayonets did you ever hear
of pumpkin yes
um but the very brief history and then
we believe is the anti-government
anti-party and Traders so we not discuss
anymore about Bach did they mention
chejado in connection with Park I never
heard of any connection with Bach okay
thank you Dr Terry please
[03:10:02] dating conversation just on the quick
just one quick second on the racism
question I do think there was a patron
patronizing view perhaps of the Koreans
per um chocolate chunk to say that also
Ignorance by the on behalf of the
Americans right they couldn't really
even distinguish the Koreans and the
Japanese and so patronizing View and
ignorance anyway we had a long day so
I'm not going to elaborate we do have a
twinings one last point
John your Koreans were she's the boss in
[03:10:32] here Koreans were pow guards in the
Japanese prisoner of war camps you're
right there was that that attitude but
some of it stemmed from that fact thank
you you can hear more from John when
you're out
um but um okay
thank you
